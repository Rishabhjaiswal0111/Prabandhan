# Prabandhan
•	Automation technique for road damage detection and classification is highly effective in road management. Machine learning algorithm have been used for the addition of weightage for the automation.

•	A dataset of 1000 images was used to train the model. In this process the types of damages like potholes, cracks and subsistent depressions are framed.

•	A deep learning-based model that can detect potholes early using images and videos which can reduce the chances of an accident. 

•	Feature selection is done and based on that feature selection and machine learning algorithms are used for classification.
